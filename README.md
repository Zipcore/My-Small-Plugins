# Description
Small coding projects I've made in the past that don't need their own repository. These projects may be outdated or even broken.

# SourcePawn
* DodgeBall Fix - Simply sets all player's to specific models on start.
* Load Timer - Loads a timer (e.g. CKSurf) for MiniGames course maps.
* Edicts - Simply counts edicts using "sm_edicts" command.
* Locked CVars - Prints out all the CVars found in sourcemod/logs/convars.txt.
* Time Limit Logger - Logs whenever somebody changes mp_timelimit.
* Frag Radio - An updated version of Frag Radio. Uses client cookies, etc.
* TF2Ware Time Limit - Enforces time limit on TF2Ware TF2 servers.
* GFL Donators - Attempts to add a sprite over GFL Supporter's player model. I'm sure this doesn't work currently.
* GFL Dynamic Slots - Attempts to change the slot count based on the amount of players playing on the server. I am not sure if this works anymore.

# PHP
* Test Website #1 - A website I've made in BootStrap long ago. One of the first websites I've made in Bootstrap.
